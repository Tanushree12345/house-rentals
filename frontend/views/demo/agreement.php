<h3>There is no specific format that a contract must follow. Generally it will include some terms, either expressed or implied, that will form the basis of the agreement. These terms may outline contract conditions or contract warranties.

Contract conditions are fundamental to the agreement. If the contract conditions are not met it is possible to terminate the contract and seek compensation or damages.

Contract warranties are less important terms and not fundamental to the agreement. You cannot terminate a contract if the warranties are not fulfilled, however, you may be able to seek compensation for any losses incurred.

When negotiating the contract terms make sure the conditions of the contract are clearly defined and agreed to by all parties.

Contracts may follow a structure that can include, but are not limited to, the following items:

details of the parties to the contract, including any sub-contracting arrangements
duration or period of the contract
definitions of key terms used within the contract
a description of the goods and/or services that your business will receive or provide, including key deliverables
payment details and dates, including whether interest will be applied to late payments
key dates and milestones
required insurance and indemnity provisions
guarantee provisions, including directorâ€™s guarantees
damages or penalty provisions
renegotiation or renewal options
complaints and dispute resolution process
termination conditions
special conditions</h3>
